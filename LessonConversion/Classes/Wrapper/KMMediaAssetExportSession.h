/**
 KMMediaAssetExportSession allow you to:
 - convert a single MPEG-TS file to a MP4 file;
 - concatenate multiple MPEG-TS files and convert it to a MP4 file.
 
 In order to concatenate multiple MPEG-TS files, they MUST have the same audio format and the same resolution. If not, a MP4 file is still produced as an output but it wont be readable.
 
 The concatenation and the conversion are done asynchronously.
 
 The conversion of a TS file into a MP4 file is done in two steps.
 
 The first step is the demuxing of the TS files. It consist of extracting the audio and the video elementary streams of the TS files and saving them into two distinct files on the disk in a temporary directory.
 
 The second step is the muxing of the two elementary streams. It consist of assemble the two elementary streams into one MP4 file.
 
 The concatenation of multiple TS files into a single MP4 file follow the same steps but the elementary streams are concatenated.
